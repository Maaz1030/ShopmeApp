# Shopme – Smart Marketplace App

This is a **React Native** project where I built a **marketplace app** similar to OLX or Facebook Marketplace. Users can post items for sale, browse listings, search and filter products, chat with sellers, and manage their profiles. All data is stored on **Firebase**, and the app supports both **Light and Dark themes** with a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in using email and password (Firebase Auth).  
- **Post Management**: Create, edit, and delete listings with images uploaded via Firebase Storage.  
- **Search & Filters**: Search for products and filter by categories.  
- **Product Feed**: Browse listings from all users in an optimized scrollable list (FlashList).  
- **Product Details**: View product images, title, price, description, and seller info.  
- **Messaging**: Chat with sellers in real-time using Firebase Firestore updates.  
- **Notifications**: Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (setup enabled).  
- **Profile Management**: View and edit profile information, including profile picture and bio.  
- **Offline Support**: Cached data and offline access using Redux Toolkit Query.  
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Light & Dark mode, fast image loading using React Native Fast Image.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
